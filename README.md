# About me

‚ñ∫ Engineer and Computer Science PhD Student with 25+ years of experience in Open Source and
GNU/Linux systems.

‚ñ∫ I would describe myself as a highly skilled computer enthusiast, very focused on highend
computing technology. This is why, since a very young age, I have challenged
myself to learn and collaborate with several Open Source projects and communities.

‚ñ∫ After several years working for big international corporations, followed by some
others as a freelance, both from Spain and traveling, my family and I have decided to
settle in Indonesia.

‚ñ∫ Alongside several heterogeneous technical fields going from CyberSecurity to Artificial
Intelligence through Embedded Systems, right now my professional career has
evolved into high-tech StartUp regular collaborations all over the globe.

‚ñ∫ I am a very focused, organized, solution-oriented multidisciplinary professional. I
enjoy working with innovative technology groups, and this is why I would like to find
commited and technologically challenging projects to get involved with.
