# Hi there üëã

# About me

‚ñ∫ Senior Computer Engineer with an extensive professional experience focused around Open Source
projects and GNU/Linux systems.

‚ñ∫ I would describe myself as a highly skilled computer enthusiast, very focused on high-end
computing technology. This is why, since a very young age, I have challenged myself to learn and
collaborate with several Open Source projects and communities.

‚ñ∫ My professional beginnings in multinational companies evolved from purely technical topics such
as SysOps, Cybersecurity and Embedded Systems to Project Management and Team Leadership. This
allowed me to assume leading responsibilities in terms of team and decision making as well as being
able to help in the personal and professional growth of my teams and collaborators.

‚ñ∫ As an entrepreneur, in 2015 I founded the Cybersecurity and AI focused Startup, EthelHub,
applying my previous experience in product development while learning about technologies such as
Cloud, DevOps and Artificial Intelligence on one hand and, on the other about Customer Research,
Marketing, Pilot Projects and Fundraising.

‚ñ∫ While the project was underway, I was also collaborating with other high-tech StartUps as a
Freelancer Consultant, which eventually opened the door for a new AI robotics StartUp project,
Crystal Robotics, and finally to create my company Xift, to continue learning, working and traveling
with my family all over the world until we finally decided to settle in Indonesia.

‚ñ∫ I am a very focused, organized, solution-oriented multidisciplinary professional. I enjoy working
with innovative technology groups, and therefore I would like to find committed and technologically
challenging projects to get involved with.
